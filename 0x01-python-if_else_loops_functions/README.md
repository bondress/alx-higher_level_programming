- You can only use one print function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 3: 3-print_alphabt.py**
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- Print all the letters except q and e
- You can only use one print function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 4: 4-print_hexa.py**
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.
- You can only use one print function with string format
- You can only use one loop in your code
- You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- You are not allowed to import any module

**Task 5: 5-print_comb2.py**
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

**Task 6: 6-print_comb3.py**
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- The last number should be followed by a new line

**Task 7: 7-islower.py**
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

**Task 8: 8-uppercase.py**
Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

**Task 9: 9-print_last_digit.py**
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

**Task 10: 10-add.py**
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

**Task 11: 11-pow.py**
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

**Task 12: 12-fizzbuzz.py**
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
- For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

**Task 13**
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

**Task 14: 100-print_tebahpla.py**
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

**Task 15: 101-remove_char_at.py**
Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

**Task 16: 102-magic_calculation.py**
Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode: https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/BO9a7nq6424lGmtmwyB4cQ
